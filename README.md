# F1-Analyser🏎️
This project aims to predict the most optimum racing line for a circuit based on various conditions like tyre type, weather, and more. 

Starting with Spa (Belgian GP), the track is digitized using a .geojson file, with edges converted into lines using matplotlib. The circuit is then divided into sections for detailed analysis. 

A digital car (planned to be a physics-based ML model) will simulate laps, analyzing the best path while providing crucial data like braking and turning points. 

Future Enhancements:

Adding more circuits 

Converting insights into a visual experience using AR/VR 🎮
