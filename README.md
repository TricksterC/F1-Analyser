# F1-Analyser
This project is going to be used to predict the most optimum racing line, given a circuit and certain conditions sych as tyre type, weather etc. A circuit (for now, the Belgian GP's circuit Spa) is digitized by using a .geojson file, and converting the track edges into lines by using matplotlib and dividing the whole circuit into sections. A sort of digital car (planning on a physics implemented ML model) will run around the track and spit out the most optimum line as output, giving crucial info like braking and turning points. Some future aspects include adding multiple circuits and converting this data into a visual form using AR/VR
